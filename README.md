"# random-numbers" 

This is a random generator app that generates a random list of 10,000 numbers from 1 to 10,000 inclusive without repeating any numbers.

To get started, clone this repository to a local directory and run npm install.

Running npm run dev will set up the developer environment including a local web server.

Navigating to http://localhost:8080 will display the web app. Reloading the page will generate a new list.

The comments in /js/client.js will walk you through my thought process and explain the various parts of the code.
